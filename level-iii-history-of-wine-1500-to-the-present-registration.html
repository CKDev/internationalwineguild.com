      style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">PLEASE NOTE: If for any reason a class is cancelled we
      will phone or e-mail you 48 hours prior to the start of the class. If a class is canceled at the last minute due
      to bad weather (this is very rare) we will reschedule the class. However, if a class is held and you decide not
      to attend because you believe the weather is bad than it will be treated as a no-show. It is highly recommended
      that you register early, your credit card will not be charged until 7-10 days in advance of the course. We must
      have a minimum number of students registered in order to form any course. If you are traveling from out of town
      to attend, please do not make travel and hotel arrangements until two weeks in advance of the course.</span></b>
