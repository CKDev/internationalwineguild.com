<h3><strong>Registration &amp; Cancellation Policy: </strong></h3>
<p>You must register for a seminar or course through the International Wine Guild. Online registration closes 1 day prior to
  class start date. If you need to register after the close date, please contact the International Wine and Spirits
  Guild at 303-296-3966.<br>
  <br>
  Because we purchase wines and food based on the number of registrants, no-shows are charged a non-refundable fee
  equal to $525 per person, unless other arrangements are made at least 7 working days in advance of the seminar.<br>
  <br>
  If for any reason a seminar is canceled we will phone or e-mail you 48 hours prior to the start of the seminar. If a
  seminar is canceled at the last minute due to bad weather (this is very rare) we will reschedule the seminar. However,
  if a seminar is held and you decide not to attend because you believe the weather is bad then it will be treated as a
  no-show.<br>
  <br>
  It is highly recommended that you register early, your credit card will not be charged until seven days in advance
  of the course. We must have a minimum students registered in order to form a course. If you are traveling from out
  of town to attend, please do not make travel arrangements until two weeks in advance of the seminar or course.</p>
