    e-mail you 48 hours prior to the start of the class. If a class is canceled at the last minute due to bad weather
    (this is very rare) we will reschedule the class. However, if a class is held and you decide not to attend because
    you believe the weather is bad then it will be treated as a no-show.<br>

      advance of the seminar or course</u>. We must have a minimum students registered in order to form a course. If
