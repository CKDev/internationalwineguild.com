  producing areas in Northern California. The experience of living in the wine
  country for many years helped him appreciate the role that wine played in
  making the special occasions in his life even more spectacular. He decided
  that sharing the joyful experience of wine with others was a way to continue
  his own education about wine, as well as, help make a positive difference in
  the quality of life for others. In 2005 he started his own wine education
  company in Colorado Springs, Colorado called “Experience Wine”. From 2005 to
  2009, his company was the only dedicated wine education company in operation
  in the ‘Springs and he received local media acclaim. Mark coordinated Level

  them transition into the wine industry. Mark has since relocated his business
  to Denver where he continues to offer private education events, while also
  expanding his affiliation with the International Wine Guild. Mark is now an
  Executive Wine Sommelier and Certified Wine Instructor with the Guild. He
