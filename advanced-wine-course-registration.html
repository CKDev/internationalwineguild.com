<h2>Registration and Cancellation Policy:</h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">You must register for courses through the
    International Wine and Spirits Guild. Online registration closes 2 days prior to the course start date. If you
    need to register after the close date, please contact the International Wine and Spirits Guild at 303-296-3966
    and we will determine if we have space or the student materials. &nbsp;Often we do, so please call.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; font-size: medium; font-family: " times="" new=""><span
    style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">
    <o:p></o:p>
  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Because our courses are extremely expensive to
    produce, a cancellation by a student within&nbsp;ten (10)&nbsp;days of the start of the course&nbsp;</span><span
    style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 9pt;">would result in a non-refundable fee of $1750.00.&nbsp; A
    student cancelling&nbsp;three (3)&nbsp;days&nbsp;prior to&nbsp;the start of a course will mean a forfeiture of the
    entire registration fees. There is a $250 fee for transferring from one course to another. If you transfer from
    one seminar to another you will still owe $1900 (or $1995) for the course to which you are transferring. &nbsp;If
    we cancel a seminar course because of insufficient registration and move you to another course there are no
    transfer costs. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; font-size: medium; font-family: " times="" new=""><span
    style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">It is highly recommended that you register early, your
    credit card will not be charged until ten days in advance of the course. We must have a minimum students
    registered in order to form a course. If you are traveling from out of town to attend, please do not make travel
    arrangements until two weeks in advance of the course.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
